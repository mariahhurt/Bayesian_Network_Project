We wrote our code in a Python Jupyter notebook. In order for this code to be
run, you must have Python installed as well as an environment (such as 
Anaconda Navigator) from which Jupyter notebook can be run.

Our dataset can be downloaded as a CSV from the following website:

https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci 

This CSV file must be stored in the same working directory from which you are
running the Python code. It should be downloaded with the name "heart.csv".

Additionally, the following packages will need to be installed prior to running
our code:
pandas, pomegranate, pygraphviz, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot

Once the data has been downloaded and the required packages have been
installed, the Jupyter notebook can be run by repeatedly clicking the "Run"
button located at the top of the screen until reaching the end of the notebook.
